# opchapterbot

A Reddit bot which gives you information about the one piece chapter you want and also provides a link to read the chapter online.

HOW TO RUN IT:

1) Clone or download this project

2) Create a praw.ini file in this project directory and type in the following statements:

    [explainbot]
    
    username: reddit username
    
    password: reddit password
    
    client_id: client_id that you got
    
    client_secret: client_secret that you got
    
    
 3) Save the praw.ini file and run the opchapterbot.py file
 
 4) Note: I'm using this bot only on r/test, but you can use it on r/OnePiece if you want.
        **Also, please don't spam this bot in every post or any other non-onepiece subreddits.**
